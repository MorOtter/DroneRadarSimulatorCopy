# MCSS
This is a copy of the code I developed during my placement.

This program is inspired by inspired by the Micromonde combat control system developed by University of Laval.
It simulates three different drone radar systems with different changing accuracies and two test scenarios to aid get the user used to the system.
The program periodically links to external qualtrics questionaires that the user must respond in order to continue.
